# Общее описание

This is a second project for my hexlet studies.
The project aims to show differences between different files.

You can clone the repository with git@github.com:SovaDekster/python-project-50.git or <https://github.com/SovaDekster/python-project-50>

For this program you might need python = "^3.10" and prompt = "^0.4.1"

## Команды

**You can use some helpful commands:**
```
   make install - just like poetry install

   make build

   make package-install - obviously, helps you to install package

   make reinstallation - you know what it means
```
